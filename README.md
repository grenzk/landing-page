# Landing Page

This project is about creating an entire web page from scratch. It is part of The Odin Project curriculum and the design of the actual web page is already provided. This will determine what I learned from each of the lessons under **_Foundations > Flexbox_** course.

## Desired Outcome
![full_design](./images/full_design.png)

### Colors and Font Styles
![colors_and_stuff](./images/colors_and_stuff.png)
